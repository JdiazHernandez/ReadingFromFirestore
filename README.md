# ReadingFromFirestore
Small JS script to read a firestore DB by name, shows the indexes of each data and have a small input to include new data.
It does not refresh automaticaly (yet) but it works fine with Firestore.

The key is the introduction of search from key components on the document and not from id.
This code allow to searh cities by name.
